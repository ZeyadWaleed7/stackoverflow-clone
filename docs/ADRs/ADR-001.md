# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Context

Our project need to support a growing number of users, questions, and answers while maintaining high availability and fault tolerance.

## Decision

Chosen to enhance scalability and maintainability. Each
service can scale independently, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and
improving fault isolation.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused services are easier to develop, test, and update.
- **Fault Isolation**: A failure in one service wonâ€™t bring down the entire system.

### Cons

- **Complexity**: Increased operational complexity due to managing multiple services, requiring more tools.
- **Latency**: Inter-service communication over the network may introduce delays.
