# ADR-002: Redis for Caching

## Context

Frequently accessed questions will be retrieved often, putting pressure on the database. A caching mechanism is needed To ensure low-latency and reduce database load.

## Decision

We will use **Redis** to reduce database hits and improve response time.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Performance**: Fast, in-memory access.
- **Reduced Load**: Fewer queries in the database, improving overall system efficiency.
- **Scalability**: can be scaled to handle cache growth.

### Cons

- **Cost**: Requires additional infrastructure and resources.
