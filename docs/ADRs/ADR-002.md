# ADR-002: Primary Database

## Context

Project needs a scalable database to store structured data. The project mandates a database design with sharding considerations to handle growth in data volume ensures reliability, scalability, and compatibility with microservices.

## Decision

We will use MongoDB as the primary database.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Schema-less design is Simple and requires no rigid table setup.
- Native sharding and replication simplify horizontal scaling as user/tweet volume grows.
- Easily accommodates new fields without schema migrations.

### Cons

- Eventual consistency by default may require extra logic for real-time timeline updates.
- Manual handling of relationships adds query complexity compared to SQL joins.
