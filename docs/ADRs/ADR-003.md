# ADR-003: PostgreSQL for User Data

## Context

User data (e.g., profiles, authentication tokens, reputation scores) requires structured storage with strong consistency guarantees, especially for operations like updating reputation or validating logins.

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL** to Ensures structured data management, supporting ACID properties for consistency in user-related operations.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Consistency**: ACID properties guarantee reliable user data updates (e.g., reputation changes).
- **Structured Data**: Well-suited for relational data like user profiles and roles.
- **Maturity**: Robust, widely-used database with strong community support.

### Cons

- **Scalability Limits**: Vertical scaling may be needed initially; sharding adds complexity for horizontal scaling.
- **Performance**: Slower for unstructured or highly flexible data compared to NoSQL options.
