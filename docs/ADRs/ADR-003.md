# ADR-003: Integration of Redis for Caching and Session Management

## Context

A project needs a memory-store implementation for caching frequently accessed data and managing user sessions to improve performance. A decision is needed on the caching technology.

## Decision

We will use **Redis** as the in-memory data store for caching posts and managing user sessions.

## Consequences

### Pros

- Fast, in-memory access reduces database load.
- Supports clustering for high availability.
- Easy integration with microservices.

### Cons

- In-memory storage can be memory-intensive.
- Requires configuration for durability.
- Adds another component to maintain.
