# ADR-008: Programming Languages

## Context

The chosen languages must support scalability, performance, and ease of integration with tools like PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, and an API Gateway.

## Decision

We will use Golang (Used for the Tweet Service and Relationship Service due to its performance and concurrency strengths) and JavaScript (Used for the Auth Service and Timeline Service due to its asynchronous capabilities and ecosystem for real-time features) as the primary programming languages

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Go**:
  - High performance and low latency for tweet CRUD and relationship management.
  - Built-in concurrency (goroutines) suits microservices handling high traffic.
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**:
  - Asynchronous I/O fits real-time timeline updates and OAuth2 authentication.

### Cons

- **Go**:
  - Less dynamic than JavaScript, requiring more upfront design.
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**:
  - Single-threaded nature.
  - Potential callback hell or dependency bloat if not managed well.
