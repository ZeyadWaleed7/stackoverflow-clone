# ADR-005: OAuth2 with Google

## Context

Users need a secure, seamless way to sign up and log in without managing separate credentials.

## Decision

We will implement **OAuth2 with Google** to Provid a secure and user-friendly authentication process, eliminating the need for password management.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Security**:Implementation of Google’s robust OAuth2 reduces our attack surface.
- **User Experience**: Simplifies login with a familiar provider.
- **Standardization**: Ensures compatibility and reliability.

### Cons

- **Dependency**: Relies on Google’s service availability.
- **Limited Providers**: Supporting only Google may exclude users preferring other OAuth providers.
