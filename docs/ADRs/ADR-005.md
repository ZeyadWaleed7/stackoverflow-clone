# ADR-009: Frameworks

## Context

Project requires frameworks to implement RESTful APIs and handle service logic efficiently. The project mandates RESTful APIs and microservices that may use different tech stacks. A decision is needed on the frameworks to ensure rapid development, performance, and compatibility with the system.

## Decision

We will use the following frameworks for the Twitter clone:

- Gin (Golang), providing a lightweight, high-performance web framework.
- Express (JavaScript), offering a flexible, minimalist framework for RESTful APIs and real-time features.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Gin**:
  - Fast routing and middleware support for RESTful APIs.
  - Minimal overhead aligns with Goâ€™s performance benefits.
- **Express**:
  - Simplifies OAuth2 implementation and real-time event handling.
  - Extensive middleware ecosystem.

### Cons

- **Gin**:
  - Less opinionated than full-stack frameworks, requiring more manual setup.
  - Smaller ecosystem compared to Node.js, limiting third-party plugins.
- **Express**:
  - Performance overhead compared to Go for high-throughput tasks.
