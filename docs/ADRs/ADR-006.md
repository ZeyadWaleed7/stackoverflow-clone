# ADR-006: Synchronous Communication for User Authentication

## Context

During login, users expect immediate feedback to confirm success or failure.

## Decision

We will use **synchronous communication** to Ensure immediate feedback to users during login, improving the user experience.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **User Experience**: Instant response improves reliability and responsiveness.
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward request-response flow for authentication.
- **Reliability**: Ensures login status is confirmed before proceeding.

### Cons

- **Blocking**: Synchronous calls may tie up resources if Googleâ€™s API is slow or unresponsive.
- **Scalability**: Heavy login traffic could pressure the authentication service without load balancing.
