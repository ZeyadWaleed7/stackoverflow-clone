# ADR-005: JWT-Based Authentication

## Context

The Twitter clone requires secure user authentication and authorization. A decision is needed on the authentication mechanism to ensure security, and compatibility with our microservices architecture.

## Decision

We will implement **JWT**. The Auth Service built with JavaScript will:

- Allow users to sign up and log in with an email and password.
- Store hashed passwords in MongoDB.

## Consequences

### Pros

- No external OAuth2 setup.
- JWT tokens provide secure, stateless authentication.
- Fully managed within our system, reducing reliance on third-party availability.

### Cons

- Requires implementing signup, password hashing.
- Token verification adds slight overhead to each request.
