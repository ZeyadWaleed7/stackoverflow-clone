# ADR-007: Asynchronous Communication for Notifications

## Context

Notifications donâ€™t require immediate delivery and can tolerate slight delays.

## Decision

We will use **asynchronous communication** a system where notifications are sent separately from other actions.

## Consequences

### Pros

- **Responsiveness**: Main actions happen quickly.
- **Reliability**: Queues ensure notifications are processed even if the notification service fails temporarily.
- **Scalability**: Notification processing can scale independently of other services.

### Cons

- **Complexity**: Requires additional infrastructure.
- **Latency**: Slight delays in notification delivery may occur.
