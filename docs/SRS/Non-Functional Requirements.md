# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance Requirements

### 1.1 Scalability

- The system should be able to handle a 40% increase in user load during peak usage periods without performance degradation.
- The system should support horizontal scaling of microservices.

### 1.2 Throughput

- The system should handle 1,000 transactions per second.
- The system should serve 50,000 concurrent users.

### 1.3 Response Time

- The system should respond to user requests within 7 sec under peak load conditions, especially during high-traffic periods.
- To achieve these response times, frequently accessed questions will be cached using Redis.

## 2. Resilience Requirements

- The system should implement circuit breakers and retries for service failures to ensure fault tolerance.
- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime, ensuring high availability.

## 3. Security Requirements

- The system should protect APIs with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure secure access.
- All user data must be transmitted over HTTPS to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

## 4. Usability Requirements

- The system should provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to sign in, post questions, submit answers, vote, and search for content with minimal learning curve (e.g., intuitive navigation and clear feedback on actions).
- The system should support accessibility standards to ensure it is usable by users with disabilities.

## 5. Maintainability Requirements

- The system should be built using a microservices architecture to enhance maintainability, allowing each service to be updated or scaled independently.
- The system should include centralized logging to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
